# What is nfTez?

nfTez is a platform to buy and sell NFTs on the Tezos ecosystem. It has the feature of swapping NFTs as well. Users can exchange their NFTs to obtain liquid tokens via this platform. In order to lower the cost of buying and selling NFTs in Tez, the market need a platform that allows for fractional purchases and sales. This is where nfTez steps in. On this platform, NFT collectors can list their NFTs for sale. who want to invest in NFTs as arbitrageurs. This platform enables anyone without sufficient funds to purchase an NFT to own a portion of an NFT.

# Inspiration

The popularity of digital art is rising every day, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have emerged as a modern trend. As a result, we believed the market required a platform where NFTs could be easily bought, sold, and swapped, particularly on the Tezos chain. To integrate all of them on a single platform, we developed nfTez, an NFT Marketplace. A platform like this does not exist on the Tezos ecosystem and this platform would bring make it more feasible to trade NFTs on the Tezos ecosystem.
